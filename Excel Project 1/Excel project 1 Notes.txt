Creating a Report based Analysis on Excel using Pivot table feature and Pivot Chart feature:

Check all the columns for Null Values and Incorrect data
Created a New Column 'Age Group' and using 'IF' Formula generated the categories based on age as 'Senior', 'Adult' and 'Teenager'
=IF(E2>=50, "Senior", IF(E2>=30, "Adult", "Teenager"))


Created a new column 'Month' and extracted the Month from the 'Date' Column using 'TEXT' formula
=TEXT(G2, "MMM")

Note: If Month format is mentioned as "MMM" only three letters of the month are populated, same way if you want to populate the entire month spelling use "MMMM"

Below are few of the reports which I worked on:

1. Compare the Sales and Orders Using Single Chart
2. Which Month Got the Highest Sales and Orders?
3. Who purchased More, Men or Women by year?
4. What are different Order statuses in 2022?
5. List Top 10 states contributing to the sales
6. Relation between age and gender based on number of orders
7. Which Channel is contributing to number of Sales?
8. Highest selling category?
